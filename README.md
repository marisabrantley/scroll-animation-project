# Scroll Animation Project

Sections on a page transition in from alternating sides when scrolling down. The opposite happens when scrolling up the page.

I used the logo, modeling photos, and text from my old handmade flower accessories show on Etsy.

## Objective
* Use CSS transitions to have the sections smoothly ease in.
* Use JavaScript to tell where the trigger point is for another section to come in.
* Add a specific CSS class to show the trigger point.
